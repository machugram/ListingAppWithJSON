A simple News app that shows a list of news items. When the user taps one of the items, a so-called detail view is shown. It shows the news item, with an image, its title, and a description

Project Name: News App



How The App Works: Machu is an avid news reader who likes to get his morning updates quickly.
Machu opens the news app while having breakfast and sees a tableview of news content with each row showing the news title and publisher.  
He taps on a news article title;"Apple facing lawsuit over privacy issues" to get more detail.  
He taps on the article in the tableview and gets a screen detailing the article with the article image, article title , article publisher and the article detail text.
